# Intro
Today we are going to work with the Palmer Penguins data to learn *RMarkdown*. 

## Load libraries
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
library(rmarkdown)
```

# Inspect the data
```{r}
paged_table(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
This plot represents penguin bill depth by bill length according to species for Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  labs(x = " Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")+
  theme_bw()
```
