Introduction,
,"Estuaries are biologically rich ecosystems, containing a multitude of productive habitats that together support a wide variety of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including humans (Barbier et al., 2011; Costanza et al., 1997; Lobry et al., 2008). Despite the large degree of anthropogenic damage that threatens the resilience of these systems, estuaries continue to serve as breeding and nursery grounds, feed and house a multitude of species, sequester carbon, protect shorelines from erosion, and provide opportunities for recreation (Barbier et al., 2011; Costanza et al., 1997; Lobry et al., 2008). Within estuaries, eelgrass meadow and oysters bed habitats are particularly notable for their biological and ecological contributions to the organisms that rely on estuarine ecosystems."
,"Eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows are highly productive coastal marine habitats that provide valuable ecosystem services and exhibit significant biological impacts across temperate regions throughout the northern hemisphere (Olsen et al., 2016). Though it is not endangered, Z. marina has experienced significant declines as a result of anthropogenically-driven changes in environmental conditions (Ehlers et al., 2008; Lefcheck et al., 2017; Orth et al., 2006). Eelgrass meadows store carbon, stabilize sediments, provide refugia from ocean acidification conditions, and increase biodiversity by providing habitat structure (Hemminga & Duarte, 2000; Orth et al., 2006; Ricart et al., 2021). As a result of its impacts on surrounding habitat and associated species assemblages, Z. marina is considered both an ecosystem engineer and a foundation species (Ehlers et al., 2008; Lefcheck et al., 2017). Z. marina can modify water flow within and around meadows, influencing nutrient cycling in the surrounding system (Hemminga & Duarte, 2000). Increases in eelgrass shoot density can provide valuable long-term storage for organic carbon within anaerobic sediments by shifting habitats from an erosional to a depositional state, promoting sediment accumulation by removing suspended particles from the water column (Fourqurean et al., 2012; Greiner et al., 2013). Z. marina meadows can also function as temporary refugia from ocean acidification conditions by raising the pH of surrounding water via photosynthesis (Buapet et al., 2013; Groner et al., 2018; Ricart et al., 2021). The temporal extent and magnitude of this amelioration is subject to variations in factors like time of day, season, latitude, and shoot density (Cyronak et al., 2018; Groner et al., 2018; Koweek et al., 2018; Ricart et al., 2021)."
,"Eelgrass meadows are the basis for incredibly productive and biologically diverse habitats, increasing three-dimensional habitat via vertical structure for ecologically and economically valuable species (Castel et al., 1989; Heck et al., 2003; Orth et al., 2016; Whitfield, 2017). Both the plant canopy and rhizome mat of eelgrass meadows provide habitat for fauna and may serve as a refuge from predation (Castel et al., 1989; Orth et al., 2016). The capacity of eelgrass to physically and chemically alter conditions of surrounding water, alongside its habitat provision, increases diversity and abundances within meadows and provides breeding grounds and nursery habitat for ecologically and economically valuable species (Barbier et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2011; Whitfield, 2017). This extensive ability of eelgrass meadows to modify their surroundings makes the comprehensive determination of their impacts crucial to understanding the functioning of the estuarine systems where seagrass is present."
,"The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) has also seen severe population declines along the west coast of North America within the last century due to anthropogenic impacts, but may strongly influence its environment in areas of high density (Polson & Zacherl, 2009; Ridlon et al., 2021). Commercial overharvesting, degradation of estuarine habitats, poor water quality, introduced species, and pollution have led to the depletion of this species from its native range to the point of commercial extinction in the 1930s (Polson & Zacherl, 2009; Ridlon et al., 2021; Trimble et al., 2009). In addition to their commercial importance, the ecological impacts of oyster beds on their surroundings have led to the designation of this species as an ecosystem engineer and foundation species (Ridlon et al., 2021). All oyster species are suspension feeders that filter particles from surrounding water, though the effectiveness of this filtration varies by species and location (Coen et al., 2007; Gray & Langdon, 2019, 2018). Oyster filtration of phytoplankton and other particles can facilitate the growth of eelgrass by increasing light penetration and removing eelgrass pathogens from the water (Groner et al., 2018; Newell & Koch, 2004; Wall et al., 2008). Oyster beds can create “living shorelines”, both alone and in conjunction with eelgrass meadows, that act as natural breakwaters to reduce erosion while conserving the integrity of surrounding habitat in ways that traditional shoreline armoring methods cannot (Ridlon et al., 2021; Scyphers et al., 2011). As seen in eelgrass meadows, the three-dimensional structure of oyster beds provides predation refugia and nursery grounds for other species, as well as habitat for feeding, nesting, and settlement; many marine and terrestrial species also feed directly on oysters (Coen et al., 2007; Grabowski & Powers, 2004; Heck et al., 2003). "
,"Much of the research on the ecological impacts of oysters has been conducted on larger oyster species, particularly species of Crassostrea, with at least two orders of magnitude fewer studies focusing on the specific ecological impacts of O. lurida (Trimble et al., 2009). While O. lurida may not necessarily match the degree of influence that larger species have on their environments due to its smaller size and depleted numbers, this does not preclude the potential for localized impacts in the vicinity of O. lurida beds, particularly in areas of high oyster density and in cases of refiltration of water within beds (Gray & Langdon, 2019, 2018; zu Ermgassen et al., 2013). Further research is needed to determine the extent of the ecological influence of beds of O. lurida on surrounding habitat as compared to larger oyster species, particularly in the context of restoration efforts for this species."
,"Zooplankton are crucial to the productivity and functioning of estuarine ecosystems (Bollens et al., 2014; Lobry et al., 2008). These organisms are an important food source for a wide range of planktivorous nekton, serving as a crucial link between smaller primary producing phytoplankton and the rest of the consumers in marine systems (Limburg et al., 1997; Thayer et al., 1974; Whitfield & Harrison, 1996). Holoplanktonic zooplankton, particularly copepods of all life history stages, are crucial to the survival of meroplankton and postlarval juveniles of a wide range of organisms spanning multiple phyla (Limburg et al., 1997; Thayer et al., 1974). Many ecologically and economically valuable organisms in estuarine systems may also start their lives as zooplankton, either retained in the system for their larval duration or recruited from other populations (Peteiro & Shanks, 2015; Roegner, 2000). Factors that influence the availability, distribution, and transport of zooplankton may considerably influence the ecological patterns seen in estuaries in ways that may extend through upper trophic levels."
,"Zooplankton are a large and varied assemblage of organisms with a wide range of natural history considerations and tolerances for environmental parameters; as a result, they also exhibit a wide range of behaviors, some of which allow for the adjustment of horizontal or vertical position in response to stimuli (Haney, 1988; Kimmerer & McKinnon, 1987; Simons et al., 2006). One such positioning behavior in some estuarine resident zooplankton is tidal vertical migration, moving upwards on the flow tide and downwards on the ebb tide using varying current speeds between depths to maintain horizontal position within an area (Kimmerer et al., 1998; Kimmerer & McKinnon, 1987; Morgan et al., 1997; Simons et al., 2006). This can benefit zooplankton by allowing them to remain in areas beneficial to their life history needs, but could also provide a mechanism by which they can rapidly respond to the changes in environmental parameters typical of dynamic estuarine systems to ensure their residence in habitats that meet their abiotic preferences (David et al., 2005; Modéran et al., 2010). Studies from a diverse array of locations worldwide have identified variations in zooplankton assemblages along gradients of salinity, water temperature, pH, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity, as well as between habitats with and without seagrass (Azmi et al., 2016; Bollens et al., 2014; Kayfetz et al., 2020; Lui et al., 2020; Marques et al., 2007; Modéran et al., 2010; Soetaert & Van Rijswijk, 1993; Zhou et al., 2009). The presence of well-established methods of horizontal and vertical position selection seen in many zooplankton combined with varying tolerances of zooplankton to different environmental conditions raises the possibility that zooplankton in dynamic, highly variable systems like estuaries may be able to behaviorally select for preferred habitats."
,"Previous studies on zooplankton in estuarine systems have shown variation in zooplankton composition and abundances across varying environmental conditions, spatial and temporal gradients, and habitats (Bollens et al., 2014; Laprise & Dodson, 1994; Marques et al., 2007; Soetaert & Van Rijswijk, 1993; Zhou et al., 2009). However, to my knowledge the only work on zooplankton conducted in Newport Bay, California to date has focused on identifying the species present in the area via DNA barcoding, with no studies focusing on characterizing the assemblages of zooplankton present in Newport Bay despite the ecological importance of these groups and their implications for overall ecosystem function (Bryant & Arehart, 2019a, 2019b, 2020). If zooplankton assemblages within the Living Shorelines restoration sites in Newport Bay vary as a result of environmental parameters, habitat types, or a combination of these factors, this may impact both food availability for zooplanktivorous organisms and larval supply to and from these habitats that could significantly influence ecosystem function. The purpose of this study is to characterize (1) environmental parameters and (2) zooplankton assemblages within neighboring eelgrass (Z. marina) meadow, oyster (O. lurida) bed, and mudflat habitats in Newport Bay to determine if zooplankton respond to differing environmental cues associated with these habitats."
,
,
Research Questions & Justification:,
"Question 1: Do environmental parameters vary between eelgrass, oyster, and mudflat habitats?",
,"To address this, I will measure environmental parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), salinity, pH, and chlorophyll a at each site using a combination of continuous and discrete methods. Mudflat sites will serve as a control lacking the three-dimensional habitat structure and metabolic activities of the sites with foundation species. Though existing studies do examine the impacts of eelgrass and oyster habitats on their surroundings, the small scale and restoration status of the plots in Newport Bay and our limited knowledge of the impacts of the O. lurida warrant the collection of data specific to this system. The impact of Z. marina habitats on adjacent water will change as a result of seasonal variability in productivity as well as differences in shoot density between sites, so pairing environmental and zooplankton data is necessary to associate changes in the zooplankton community with potential habitat effects. As most studies on the impacts of oysters on surrounding water focus on larger reef-forming oysters, measurements from these sites will also be necessary to determine the specific degree of impact of the smaller O. lurida, if present."
,"I hypothesize that Z. marina and oyster habitats will exhibit species-specific differences in environmental parameters from each other and from mudflat habitat. I predict that the effects of Z. marina photosynthesis will lead to higher pH and DO in these plots during the day, with either lower pH and DO as a result of respiration or no difference in pH and DO from other sites at night. I expect chlorophyll a to be lower in O. lurida habitats as a result of the removal of phytoplankton from the water by filter-feeding activity, with potential for lower pH and DO due to the effects of respiration from the oysters and the additional fauna they support combined with the localized reduction of primary productivity from the removal of phytoplankton. I also expect that temperature and salinity may differ in Z. marina and oyster sites as compared to mudflat sites, though the direction and degree of the effect may widely vary; vertical structure can lead to higher water retention times where warming and evaporation can take place, but this vertical structure may provide shade as well, particularly in areas with dense Z. marina canopy."
,
"Question 2: Do zooplankton assemblages differ between eelgrass, oyster bed, and mudflat habitats, and do these differences correspond to differing environmental cues between habitats?",
,"To investigate this, I will conduct plankton tows at each site to characterize the zooplankton present among and between habitat types. I expect patterns among and between habitats to vary on a temporal scale and between zooplankton taxa, size classes, and life history stages. Overall, I predict that total zooplankton abundance will be highest in Z. marina habitats; I expect that the structure of these meadows will increase passive retention of zooplankton that are not actively selecting for certain habitats, while also attracting taxa or life history stages of taxa seeking shelter from visual predators, particularly meroplankton in late larval stages exhibiting pre-settlement behaviors. I predict that the abundance of larger size classes of zooplankton will be greater in O. lurida habitats as compared to mudflat habitats due to the same consequences of the provision of three-dimensional structure predicted for Z. marina habitats, but I expect that the abundance of smaller size classes will be lowest in this habitat due to consumption by O. lurida. "
,I will also be looking specifically for O. lurida larvae within my zooplankton samples to determine the larval supply to each oyster restoration plot. I aim to determine if differences in O. lurida larval supply to each site relate to the patterns of settlement and recruitment observed by Living Shorelines partners at the oyster bed restoration plots. Combining data on larval supply with data collected on O. lurida settlement and recruitment at these sites may help contextualize differences in relative successes between restoration plots.
,"If Z. marina and O. lurida habitats exhibit differences in water parameters as a result of species-specific influences, and if zooplankton assemblages differ consistently between these site types, I expect to see differences in assemblages in each of these site types that correspond to environmental gradients as outlined above. Even if zooplankton assemblages or environmental parameters do not differ between habitat types, I predict that differences will still occur across any environmental gradients present due to varying tolerances of water conditions and behavioral considerations between and among zooplankton taxa.  "

Methods,
Study Site:,
,"This study will be conducted using the Living Shorelines restoration project sites in Upper Newport Bay, CA. These sites are located in four locations off of the Pacific Coast Highway, Westcliff Road, DeAnza Peninsula, and Shellmaker Road.  Each location consists of four plots, and each plot contains paired treatments spanning the intertidal and subtidal. Plot types include intertidal mudflat/subtidal mudflat, intertidal mudflat/subtidal eelgrass, intertidal oyster/subtidal mudflat, and intertidal oyster/subtidal eelgrass. Intertidal portions of the plots are 20m long spanning the shoreline by 1.5m wide extending from the shore, and subtidal portions are 20m long spanning the shoreline by 8m wide extending from the shore. Z. marina in the restoration sites was acquired from nearby healthy donor beds and replanted into restoration plots, and O. lurida beds were established using Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) shells in coconut coir fiber bags 0.5m below mean lower low water (MLLW) for O. lurida settlement."
,
Question 1:,
,"To measure continuous environmental parameters between and among habitats, sensors will be deployed using sand anchors installed within or just outside each habitat as permitted by instrument availability and substrate type to measure temperature and dissolved oxygen (PME miniDOT), as well as light (HOBO, specs need to be filled in here). Additional temperature sensors (HOBO Water Temperature Pro v2) may be deployed at an additional height in the water column to identify any water stratification that may be present. Each zooplankton collection will be paired with a handheld CTD (Sontek Castaway) cast to identify = vertical stratification in the water column if present and document the temperature and salinity that the collected zooplankton were immediately present in. I will also collect discrete water samples from the surface of each site during zooplankton sampling to measure spectrophotometric pH and chlorophyll a at the time of collection. Replicate water samples will be filtered in the field and undergo acetone extraction to determine chlorophyll a concentration via spectrophotometer (Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer). Chalk dissolution blocks will be deployed at each site to identify relative water movement within and between habitats. During each instance of discrete data collection, I will also record any additional factors that may influence then environmental parameters under consideration, including weather, tidal height, and season."
Data Analysis:,
,"I will use nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) to visualize differences in environmental parameters between habitat types, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, light, pH, chlorophyll a, and chalk block dissolution rates. I will then quantify those differences in environmental parameters using a PERMANOVA. All analysis and data visualization will be performed using the statistical software R."
Question 2:,
,"To characterize zooplankton communities at each sampling site, I will conduct handheld horizontal plankton tows along the length of the plots for each site on the high slack tide bimonthly (just put this in as a placeholder; need to decide on what I’ll actually need) using a (insert mesh size here) zooplankton net with a diameter of (insert spec here). The net will be equipped with a flowmeter (insert flowmeter specs here) to estimate total volume of water filtered for each sample. Each sample will be filtered on-site and preserved in 80 percent ethanol for preservation until samples can be sorted. Samples will be subdivided in the lab using a Folsom plankton splitter until subsamples of 200-500 organisms each are obtained. Three subsamples from each sample will be transferred to a plankton counting tray for enumeration and identification, though an additional sample may be counted to ensure accuracy if two samples show a difference in abundance of more than 20%. Zooplankton will be identified to the lowest taxonomic classification possible, with life history stage included when applicable. Methods described above were influenced by the sampling and methodology considerations outlined by Kayfetz et al. (2020). "
Data Analysis:,
,I will use nMDS to visualize differences in zooplankton assemblages between habitat types and quantify those differences using PERMANOVA. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) will then be used to relate patterns seen in environmental variables across habitats to patterns in zooplankton assemblages across habitats. All analysis and data visualization will be performed using the statistical software R.

,
Significance,
,"As estuaries worldwide continue to face degradation as a result of direct human destruction, pollution, and an ever-warming sea, it becomes increasingly important to understand and maintain the provisions of these unique ecosystems. Newport Bay is one of a handful of estuaries left in Southern California that have avoided total destruction for so long; while it is by no means untouched by human impact, it continues to support an incredible diversity of marine and terrestrial organisms while also serving as a site for recreation, education, and research. Restoration projects like Living Shorelines create opportunities to augment populations of Z. marina and O. lurida and further study the ways in which impact the biology and chemistry of their surroundings, particularly in the case of the understudied O. lurida, while simultaneously bolstering the ability of Newport Bay to provide for its resident and transient fauna. The zooplankton within these habitats serve as a crucial food resource for the larger fauna attracted by Z. marina and O. lurida habitats, and the support these habitats provide for meroplankton and postlarval juveniles of a wide variety of species perpetuates the diversity and productivity of these habitats. By combining measurements on the habitats, environmental parameters, and zooplankton present within a given area, we construct a basis for understanding the breadth of the ecology we can expect to see in that area that could potentially be applicable to comparable habitats found in similar estuaries. Having this knowledge allows us to set expectations for the degree of biodiversity a habitat can support and the ecosystem services that habitat can provide, which is crucial to communicate effectively when advocating for further preservation and restoration of these vital systems.
